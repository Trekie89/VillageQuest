# VillageQuest
 
This is my attempt at creating a platformer/simulator game. 

## Game Concept

Your village has been destroyed and all your fellow villages have either run off or been taken by dragons. It is up to you to fight deadly monsters, answer tough questions, gather materials, rebuild your village and gather your fellow villages. Do you think you are up to the task?

## First Goal

- [ ] Get the area for the new village created and the sprite working. 

## Second Goal

- [ ] Create one area to go into to fight enemies and gather materials.
